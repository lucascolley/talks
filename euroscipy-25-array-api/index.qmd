## Agenda

1. The Idea, Motivation, and Solution
2. Tour of the Ecosystem
3. Status and Looking Forwards

# The Idea

## Arrays

- N-dimensional, grid-like data structure
- Most famously, `numpy.ndarray`
- "rectangular" shape, data type
- fast, easy to manipulate
- used everywhere

## Ecosystem

- Diagram from SciPy talk (credit it)
- diagram with lines removed (divided to unified)
- idea of the talk: some consuming libs very specifically consume one type of array, integrated into that ecosystem. But some other consuming libs are not really tied to one array type, or are only so tied by happenstance. The functionality itself in theory just consumes "arrays" of some sort

# Motivation

## Why? — End Users

- want to be able to switch array libraries without reinventing their entire stack
    - real-world example: Reinforcement Learning, shifting their pipelines to JAX (ref: https://github.com/luchris429/purejaxrl,)
- avoid repeated transfers between array libraries or devices in their pipelines
- try out new hardware
- try out functionality specific to an array library

## Why? — Array *consuming* libraries

- provide users with hardware acceleration and interoperability
- *without* maintenance burden increasing massively

## Why? — Array *providing* libraries

- given a concrete API to aim to implement
- rewarded with automatic compatibility with consuming libraries

## Why? — Ecosystem

- reduce duplication
- functionality maintained in one place
- diagrams from last year

# Solution

## How?

- array-agnostic code
- the implementation approach: expanding circle diagram

## The Consortium

- 'The Consortium for Python Data API Standards'
- [https://data-apis.org]()
- cross-ecosystem consortium
- has been working on this for 5 years now

# Tour of the ecosystem

- diagram — the libraries making this implementation possible

## Tour — [`array-api`](https://data-apis.org/array-api/)

- what is it?
- who is it for? providers/consumers/end-users?

## The Array API Standard

- link to Aaron's SciPy talk
- past work, design principles, methodology

## Tour — [`array-api-tests`](https://data-apis.org/array-api-tests/)

- what is it?
- who is it for? providers/consumers/end-users?

## Tour — [`array-api-compat`](https://data-apis.org/array-api-compat/)

- what is it?
- who is it for? providers/consumers/end-users?
- what does real usage look like?

## Tour — [`array-api-strict`](https://data-apis.org/array-api-strict/)

- what is it?
- who is it for? providers/consumers/end-users?
- what does real usage look like?

## Tour — [`array-api-extra`](https://data-apis.org/array-api-extra/)

- what is it?
- who is it for? providers/consumers/end-users?
- what does real usage look like?

## Tour — [`array-api-typing`](https://github.com/data-apis/array-api-typing)

- what is it?
- who is it for? providers/consumers/end-users?

# Status

## Status — Ecosystem Overview

- summarise support across providers and consumers

## Status — Array Libraries

- ...

## Status — `scipy`

- what is it using that I've talked about so far
- what else is it using?
- enable with experimental env var
- coverage docs
- checkout out Evgeni's talk tomorrow for more info on recent and future SciPy work: https://euroscipy.org/talks/VAPDZX/

## Status — `scikit-learn`

- ...

## Bonus Projects

- marray
- quantity-array (prototype)
- ...

## What's next?

- wider ecosystem adoption
- ...
- upstream testing utilities from `scipy`/`scikit-learn` to `array-api-extra`

## What else?

- SciPy compiled code: delegation, translation, dispatching
- ...

## With thanks to:

- all contributors to the projects discussed in this talk
- Ralf Gommers for leadership of the Consortium
- Patrick J. Roddy for this Quarto talk template
- the EuroSciPy organisers and volunteers!
