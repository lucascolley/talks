## Arrays

- what is an array?
- used everywhere

## Ecosystem

- Diagrams from SciPy talk
- fractured to unified

# Motivation

## Why? — End Users

- want to be able to switch array libraries without reinventing their entire stack
- try out new hardware
- try out functionality specific to an array library

## Why? — Array *consuming* libraries

- provide users with hardware acceleration and interoperability
- *without* maintenance burden increasing massively

## Why? — Array *providing* libraries

- given a concrete API to aim to implement
- rewarded with automatic compatibility with consuming libraries

## Why? — Ecosystem

- reduce duplication
- functionality maintained in one place
- diagrams from last year

# Solution

## How?

- array-agnostic code
- the implementation approach: expanding circle diagram

# Tour of the ecosystem

- diagram — the libraries making this implementation possible

## Tour — `array-api`

- developed by a cross-ecosystem consortium
- what is it?
- who is it for? providers/consumers/end-users?

## The Array API Standard

- link to Aaron's SciPy talk
- past work, design principles, methodology

## Tour — `array-api-tests`

- what is it?
- who is it for? providers/consumers/end-users?

## Tour — `array-api-compat`

- what is it?
- who is it for? providers/consumers/end-users?
- what does real usage look like?

## Tour — `array-api-strict`

- what is it?
- who is it for? providers/consumers/end-users?
- what does real usage look like?

## Tour — `array-api-extra`

- what is it?
- who is it for? providers/consumers/end-users?
- what does real usage look like?

## Tour — `array-api-typing`

- what is it?
- who is it for? providers/consumers/end-users?

# Status

## Status — Ecosystem Overview

- summarise support across providers and consumers

## Status — Array Libraries

- ...

## Status — `scipy`

- enable with experimental env var
- coverage docs

## Status — `scikit-learn`

- ...

## Bonus Projects

- marray
- quantity-array (prototype)
- ...

## What's next?

- wider ecosystem adoption
- ...
- upstream testing utilities from `scipy`/`scikit-learn` to `array-api-extra`

## What else?

- dispatching

## Thanks!
